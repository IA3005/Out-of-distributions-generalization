This is my third-year project with @Badr Idrissi (https://github.com/BadrYoubiIdrissi), @Mohammed Amine Hachicha (https://github.com/MedAmineHachicha) and @Pierre Houdain (https://github.com/HoudouinPierre).
It investigates different approaches of out-of-distribution generalization. 
In particular, I was interested in the adaptation of the adversarial information factorization method and the study of link between the invariant risk minimization (IRM) and adversarial methods from the pointview of information thoery.
